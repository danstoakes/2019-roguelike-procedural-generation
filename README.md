# RoguelikeProceduralGeneration
RoguelikeProceduralGeneration is a Unity-based game which procedurally generates random dungeons. Each dungeon features 10 rooms connected by random paths. This project was originally a game, whereby a player would navigate the dungeon and avoid an enemy. Now, however, the project features only the procedural dungeon generation.

Originally written in the winter of 2019.

# Installation
Download the containing folder via GitHub, extract it, and open it via Unity Hub. 

There is no camera used in this project as it didn't yield any benefits (as it's not a game), therefore the Scene window should be used to view generated dungeons.
